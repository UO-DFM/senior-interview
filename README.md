# DFM Senior Assesment

This repository contains an assessment for the Department of Family Medicine's Senioe Software Developer position, written in November 2022.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Description

This repository contains an Next app that uses Tailwind CSS and Markdown to host blogs.

Blogs have 7 different properties: 
- A title
- A date
- An excerpt
- A cover image
- An author
- An author image

## Task

Your task for this assessment will be to Dockerize the application and deploy it

- The container deployed should not exceed 100 mb of memory usage when deployed (bonus: the container has less than 50 mb when deployed).
- You will have to deploy the image on a virtual server hosted on the cloud (for example, an EC2 instance on AWS or GCE on GCP).

Once you have written your implementation, open a pull request on this repository. This should be finished before your interview. Your submission will be evaluated based on code organization, efficiency, documentation, and style.
